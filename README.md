# Writer's Realm

## Description 

- I decided to make this problem to tackle the issue with being creative. It can be pretty daunting to open a Word document and begin to write from scratch so I wanted to create a platform where users can log in and set how many chapters they want and write and edit each chapter but also publish that chapter to a communicate of other writes and hear feedback about the project they have.
